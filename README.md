# Smart-Bio-Adaptive-Street-lightning-System
For this project, I set out to create a smart street lighting system that goes beyond traditional lighting by adapting to human emotions, environmental conditions, and surrounding activity. The idea was to make street lighting more responsive, energy-efficient, and aligned with smart city goals.
The system integrates several advanced technologies, starting with emotion detection via a camera using DeepFace AI. This component allows the lights to adjust based on the emotional atmosphere of the surrounding area. For example, if a crowd seems anxious or stressed, the lighting can automatically shift to warmer tones to create a more calming environment. If the area seems lively or active, the lights can brighten up to match the activity level.
In addition to the emotion recognition system, the street lights also collect real-time sensor data from various environmental sensors like motion detectors, noise sensors, and air quality sensors. The motion sensors track foot traffic or vehicles passing by, and based on the movement, the lights adjust their brightness. The noise sensors can determine if the area is quiet or noisy, and the system changes the lighting to reflect this — for example, dimming when no one is around or brightening during busy times. The air quality sensor ensures that the lighting adapts in areas with poor air quality, which can help prioritize lighting in areas where it’s most needed.
The heart of the system is built on Raspberry Pi, which serves as the central hub for managing data from all these sensors and controlling the adaptive RGB LED lights. The lighting not only adjusts to the real-time data but is also designed to be energy-efficient, reducing power usage when there is little activity or when the air quality is good. The RGB LEDs change colors to reflect the real-time conditions — for example, changing to a cool blue when the area is calm and clean, or switching to a warm yellow when there's higher foot traffic or noise.
Overall, this system aims to improve public safety by ensuring that the right level of lighting is provided when and where it’s needed, making areas feel safer at night while still reducing energy consumption. It also supports smart city goals by creating a more responsive, sustainable, and intelligent urban environment. The project was a great hands-on experience for me in combining AI, IoT, and environmental awareness into a practical solution that can make cities smarter and more efficient.
